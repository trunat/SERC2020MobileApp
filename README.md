This is the main repository for the official SASE USF South East Regional Conference 2020 Mobile Application development.  This mobile application will be developed by the technology committee of SASE USF.  The scope of this application is to act as the foundation for the conference.  Key features will include allowing guests to sign in to the conference through the application, maps of the conference grounds, and itineraries for the various events and workshops throughout the day which will include information about them as well as on the three speakers for the conference.
